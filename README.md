# EpisodeBag
#### Track television episode information

**Features:**
* Choose which shows to follow, see recent/upcoming episodes
* Unreliable TVRage API
* Fuzzy proper noun matching for finding shows already in the system (and sometimes for discovering completely unrelated shows)

**Installation:**

Probably best to wait until a later version, but if you really want to:
```
npm install request, express, levenshtein
```
You'll also probably want node.js installed.
