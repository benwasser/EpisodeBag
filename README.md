#### TV Guide for the 21st Century

See the live site [here](http://tvlocker.com/)

**Features:**
* Choose which shows to follow dynamically
* See upcoming and recent episodes
* Uses the unreliable TVRage API
* Fuzzy proper noun matching for finding shows already in the system (and sometimes for discovering completely unrelated shows)

**Installation:**

```
npm install request, express, levenshtein to project directory
```
You'll also probably want node.js installed.

**License:**

[Unlicense](http://unlicense.org/) license, but if you use it, it would be nice if you let me know
